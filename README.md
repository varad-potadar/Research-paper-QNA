📑 DocQuery — Document-Grounded Question Answering System

DocQuery is a lightweight document intelligence system that allows users to upload PDFs and ask questions grounded strictly in the content of the document.

The system works across research papers, resumes, and other structured or semi-structured documents, producing accurate answers without hallucination.


✨ Key Features

Upload and process academic research papers (PDF)

Robust text extraction from single- and multi-column papers

Intelligent text chunking with overlap

Semantic retrieval using FAISS

Accurate, document-grounded answers

Clean, minimal Streamlit user interface

Fast inference using Groq LLM API

Secure API key handling via environment variables

⚙️ Setup Instructions (Local)
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd research-paper-qna

2️⃣ Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Configure environment variable
Create a .env file in the project root:
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

5️⃣ Run the app
streamlit run app.py

The application will open at:
http://localhost:8501

🌐 Deployment (Streamlit Cloud)

Push the project to GitHub (without .env)
Go to https://streamlit.io/cloud
Create a new app from your repository

Set Main file path to:
app.py

Add the following Secret:
GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key_here"

Deploy
Streamlit Cloud will handle installation and execution automatically.


🔐 Security & API Key Handling

API keys are never hardcoded
.env is ignored via .gitignore
Streamlit Cloud secrets are used for production
Keys are accessed via os.getenv("GROQ_API_KEY")
This ensures the API key is never exposed in the repository or UI.


🎯 Design Principles

Document-grounded answers only
The system explicitly avoids generating information not present in the source document.

Minimal infrastructure
No external vector databases or backend servers are required.

Robust over clever
Avoids brittle heuristics for document structure.

Clarity over features
Focuses on correctness and explainability.


⚠️ Limitations

Single document per session
No persistent storage between sessions
Optimized for text-based PDFs (not scanned images)
These limitations are intentional to keep the system simple and stable.


🚀 Possible Future Improvements

Citation highlighting in answers
Multi-document support
Answer confidence scoring
Export answers with references
Improved PDF layout handling


📌 Project Motivation

DocQuery was built to demonstrate:

End-to-end document understanding

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Practical LLM integration

System debugging and design decisions

Secure deployment practices
